# Mobile-Performance-Test
Simple text-only clock application to compare React Native vs. Flutter vs. Native performance

In a rainy day I got myself thinking how reliable the affirmation "Native Performance" really was when using React Native and Flutter. So, following the Quick Start introduction page from each platforms/frameworks I created this three projects. 

The product requirement for this experiment is: 
- Show the current time in a Text ui element in the following format: `yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss milliseconds`
- Refresh the text every 1 millisecond by writing the new time in the screen
